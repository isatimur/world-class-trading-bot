"Expert Trading Advisor: Market Briefing & Action Plan

Current Market Conditions Assessment:
Right now, the market is sending us very mixed signals. Bitcoin is acting as the stable anchor, 
while Solana shows incredible strength with massive volume. This is a 'coin-picker's market' 
where you need to be selective.

Specific Trading Opportunities:
1. The Momentum Play - Long SOLUSDT: Solana is the strongest horse in the race right now
2. The Stability Play - Range Trading BTCUSDT: Bitcoin is stable and trading within a predictable range
3. The Watchlist - ETHUSDT & ADAUSDT: Wait for clear signs of a bottom

Risk Management Recommendations:
- Always Use a Stop-Loss: This is non-negotiable
- The 1% Rule: Never risk more than 1% of your total trading capital
- Position Sizing: Use smaller positions for high volatility assets like SOL"
